[Posted on April 28, 2015](http://blog.jquery.com/2015/04/28/jquery-1-11-3-and-2-1-4-released-ios-fail-safe-edition/) by Timmy Willison

Here we are again. It’s too late for April Fools, so you can believe us when we tell you that we have two new patch releases for you: jQuery 1.11.3 and 2.1.4.

These releases include a [hot-fix for a rare bug in iOS 8.2 and 8.3](http://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2145). This is the only change. As with 1.11.2 and 2.1.3, we do not anticipate any issues when upgrading. However, if you do encounter bugs in upgrading from the previous versions, please let us know.

You can include these files directly from the jQuery CDN if you like, or copy them to your own local server. The 1.x branch includes support for IE 6/7/8 and the 2.x branch does not.

These updates are already available as the current versions on npm and Bower. Information on all the ways to get jQuery is available at [https://jquery.com/download/](http://jquery.com/download/). Please keep in mind that public, third-party CDNs receive their copies today and it can take a few days to post the files. If you’re anxious to get started, our CDN is always available.

Many thanks to all of you who participated in this release by testing, reporting bugs, or submitting patches, including John-David Dalton, Michał Gołębiowski, Oleg Gaidarenko, Richard Gibson, Dave Methvin, Benjamin Poulain, and Oz Solomon.

Thanks for all your support, and we look forward to showing you all we have in store for jQuery 3.0!
