# md2html-online demo

This app demonstrates the conversion of markdown to HTML via javascript. Example markdown may be generated or manually entered/pasted into the text box whose contents will be converted at the click of a button.

Upon conversion, the HTML source code is presented in another text box with click-to-copy functionality.  The HTML is also rendered.
